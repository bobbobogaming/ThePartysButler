## Characters

### The party

* Lillea Godard
	* Halfling
	* Female
	* Full Description:
		> Lillea is a about 90 cm tall halfling female, of an adult age. She wears a set of a set of dark travelers clothes (while it probably has a hood, she would not use it), that looks to be well used but also well kept, over this she wears a set of dark leather armor. If you have thought about it/asked her, then these clothes appear to be of this color not for the look, but for the practical use. She has lapis colored eyes and lightly tanned skin, she wears her long chestnut colored hair in a loose ponytail. She carries 2 shortswords, and what looks to be some sort of magic bag. From her hip hangs a sling and a pouch of something (really just bullets for the sling not really a secret). She looks very friendly. Lillea carries herself in a very happy way, she almost spring in her step. She is very nice and talkative.

* Ash Oarsman
	* Says he's a human (Actually Half-Celestial)
	* Male
    * Full Description:
        > Ash is a spry pale young human by all accounts. He is of average build, not in the most fit of shape, but certainly not as portly as others from noble birth. This may be because of his recent growth spurt, as he is quite young, or it may be some other reason he could have been excluded from the typical upbringing befit of his ilk. His dark charcoal hair has a shock of pale silver through it which is accentuated by his relatively short cropped hair. His eyes glow a stark emerald which seem to carry sadness or shame behind them when no one is looking. He carries his mace and shield with him, though he clearly and often favours the holy symbol of the pendant of a skeletal arm holding balanced scales. Short tempered, and often quick to frustration, he is slowly learning to temper this with kindness and friendship he is finding in his new found family.
        (in an ideal world Ash would have had his mace fashioned like a  censer and was going to commission it the next time we were back in a city with a black smith, so he could spread smoke and pleasant smells during battle)

	* Half-Elf
	* Female
* Maraziath ~~Cragmourn~~ Thulavea
